## Entity Inventory
for every heroes and every entity, they will have their own inventory where they can only store up to 10 different
items with max stack of 99. but mostly you don't want to keep your item in one entity, you will always want to put
the item in shared inventories

## Shared Inventory
unlike the Entity Inventory which is trait inherited by every entity, Shared inventory is a building with sole purpose
as larger item storage and item provider for every entity nearby to use. so basically it has 3 main functions

1. To Stores object with more stack number and to give any entity the item needed
2. To instantly give nearby character / heroes item when crafting without to hold the item itself

every Shared Inventory have their own range which give effect for every entity inside the range. the larger the shared
Inventory building is, the larger the range is. and you can connect the range

and for the sake of quality of life, there will be a button to assign character to do sort, button to make every entity
in range to store the item sorted accordingly / in the right places

## Moveable Shared Inventory
of course there will be another type of Shared Inventory which is the moveable Shared Inventory where it share
the same purpose with the building / normal one, but this type hold less item but is moveable using entity as it "rider"

# Build
## Systems
Building system in Throwback Kingdom will feel and look like this:

1. open building menus
2. select building to build
3. place it without cost, there will be "construction site"
4. the construction site can receive items from entity and if every item is complete. the build will be started
5. wait till the building is finished
ps. you can cancel this and it will give you back every item you already commit to it
