the pros of using RPG mode is that you have more control over the heroes so that you can the death of the 
heroes itself.

while the cons of using RPG mode is that you will have less advantage on controlling multiple unit like in 
war. although in RPG mode you have macro to give command for other unit to follow, it is more versatile to 
use RTS mode when you want to control multiple unit

### RTS

and you can even give them automation so that they do the task over and over.

the cons is: it is hard to fully control a heroes or unit because of how RTS control are. 
so that your heroes could die if you don't control them frequent enough to dodge

after the kingdom achieved the stage 4 - and so on: it is recomended to use RTS mode more often
